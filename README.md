# WakeOnLan

Description: WakeOnLan enables you to wake up all servers/clients in the same subnet.

# Possibilities

1. Wake up all servers and clients
2. Wake up a defined group of servers and/or clients
3. Define a point in time, when servers/clients should be woken up

## How to handle the app

1. Servers and clients have to be added manually
2. Within the settings activity define whether you want to wake up all server individually
   or by group name
3. Within the settings activity define the port (7 or 9) where the wake on lan package should be sent
4. Editing already defined servers:
4.1 By pressing longer onto a selected item in the list a dialog will be opened where you can
    either choose "DELETE" the selected entry or "UPDATE"
5.  Within the main activity you can choose to delete all entries from the list and the database
    immediately
6.  Choose whether to import server/clients from CSV or Database
7.  Groups of server and/or clients can be woke up either from an imported Csv or from the database content
